Tinymmo-python is a very small, 'Minorly mulitplayer online role playing game'. Developed so that I may better understan python network game programming.

This game uses works from https://opengameart.org/.

Requires python 2.7

Tested on Mac OSX 10+


## Setup using virtual environment:

```
git clone https://github.com/dslice25/tinymmo-server.git
cd tinymmo-server
virtualenv pyenv
source pyenv/bin/activate
pip install twisted pytmx pyglet
```

### Quickstart:

After setting up in a virtual environment you should be able to run the server and client. By default server listens on localhost:10000.
